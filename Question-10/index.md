# What is the difference between null and undefined in JS?

# undefined
--> When a variable is declared but has not been assigned a value, it is
automatically initialized with undefined.

--> Undefined can be used when you don't have the value right now, but you will get it after some logic or operation.

# null
--> null variables are intentionally assigned the null value.
--> Null can be used, when you are sure you do not have any value for the particular variable.
