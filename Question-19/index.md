# What is a loop? What are the types of loops in JS?

--> A loop is a programming way to run a piece of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

# For loop 
    -> For loop allows to iterate a block of code as specific number of times.
    -> for loop is better for condition with initialization and with increment because all can Get in just one line of code.

# while loop
    -> While loop execute a block of code while a certain condition is true.
    -> While loop is better when there is only condition, no initialization, no increment.
