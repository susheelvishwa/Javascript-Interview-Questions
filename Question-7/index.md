# What are variables? What is the difference between var, let, and const? v. IMP.


# Var
    --> variables are used to store data
    var count = 10 like that
    --> var creates a function scope variable.

# let
    --> let create a block scoped variable

# Const 
    --> const can be assign only once, and its value cannot be change afterwords
