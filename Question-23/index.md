# What is the difference between named and anonymous functions? When to use what in applications?

# named function
    -> Named functions have a name identifier
    -> Use named functions for big and complex logics.
    -> Use when you want to reuse one function at multiple places.

# anonymous function
    -> Anonymous functions do not have a name identifier and cannot be referenced directly by   name.
    -> Use anonymous functions for small logics.
    -> Use when want to use a function in a single place.
