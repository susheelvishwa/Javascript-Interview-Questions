# What are promises in JavaScript?

*Important points about promises:*

--> Promises in JavaScript are a way to handle asynchronous operations.
--> A promise represents a value that may not be available yet but will be
    available at some point in the future.
--> Promise can be in one of three states: pending, resolved, or rejected.
--> Promises are useful in doing asynchronous operation and handle the results when the result will be available in future.
